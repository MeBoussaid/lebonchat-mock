Hello,

A test done for leboncoin.fr, in mid 2O22, using react (next.js), and a test backend built on several AWS services facilitated by AWS amplify.

ðŸ”´ 08 Nov. 2024 : something seems broken in AWS Amplify
So the live demo is no longer working properly : Still inspecting
==> you still can sign in / but conversations are no longer fetched from AWS
#Demo : Live Chat
https://main.dbm0c19przzv6.amplifyapp.com
ðŸ”´

You can sign-in multiple users at the same time in different browsers or devices and chat between them live.

#Test users :
